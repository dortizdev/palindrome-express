## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express
HTML and CSS was used to create webpage. Javascript was used for DOM manipulation. Used NodeJS and Express module to run it as a local server.

## Lessons Learned
Always make multiple copies and use different file names. If not, you may inadvertanly delete or replace the specific files/folder you want the way that I did. Always make multiple copies and store it in different locations lke on github and a flashdrive.

Big thank you to Kaniah for her assistance after I foolishly deleted all my code, resulting in having to do it all over again.
